# DQN for Breakout

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to play the Atari game Breakout. The DQN is trained using reinforcement learning techniques to learn an optimal policy for playing the game. The project uses the OpenAI Gym environment to simulate the Breakout game and the PyTorch library to implement the DQN model.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary packages for running the DQN model on Breakout.
